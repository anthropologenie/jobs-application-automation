# Nov 12, 2025 - Day 1 Sprint 1: Integration Over Duplication

## What Got Built
- ✅ Sacred work tracking system (database + API + UI)
- ✅ End-to-end tested - ALL TESTS PASSED
- ✅ Stone 1 placed: "System Integration Complete"
- ✅ Resume updated with job tracker project
- ✅ System committed to GitHub

## Key Architectural Decision
**Extension over duplication.** We almost built a separate system.
Parliament caught it. Extended existing jobs-tracker.db instead.

This is sovereignty-aligned: honor what works, integrate what's needed.

## Time Investment
- Database migration: 10 min
- API endpoints: 15 min
- Dashboard UI: 20 min
- Testing: 15 min
- Resume update: 30 min
- **Total: 1.5 hours**

## What I Learned
Claude Code as precision execution agent = powerful.
Treating AI as Kragentic Parliament = effective architectural reviews.
Building the system while using the system = dogfooding works.

## Tomorrow (Nov 13)
**4-6 AM:** Sacred Work - AGQ Framework v0.1 design
**9 AM-12 PM:** Apply to 9 jobs (Wellfound 3, TestDevJobs 6)
**4-5 PM:** SQL practice - window functions (4 problems)
**8-9 PM:** Sacred Work Stone 2 - Log AGQ Framework work

## Felt Sense
Grounded. The foundation is solid. Tomorrow we apply.

The grandmother waits. The temple has its first wing.
